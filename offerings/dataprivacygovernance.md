# Data privacy and governance
{: #data-privacy-and-governance}

*(This {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} Data Privacy and Governance update was originally published 20 April 2016.)*

As a pioneer in the provision of a fully managed and globally distributable Database-as-a-Service,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} allows customers to locate data in any
global {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} or AWS region.
By providing customers with such high levels of data mobility to serve the local needs of customers,
{{site.data.keyword.IBM}}
and {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} take data privacy and governance seriously.

To govern the movement of data from the EU to the US,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} complied with both US-EU and US-Swiss
[Safe Harbour Frameworks](https://www.export.gov/safeharbor_eu){: new_window}{: external}.
The European Court of Justice
[invalidated](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=169195&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=113326){: new_window}{: external}
the Safe Harbour agreement in 2015. 
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} was quick to urge policymakers to work expediently
to ensure "[unbroken data flows between the European Union and the United States](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_16_216){: new_window}{: external}".

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} prepared an EU Model Clauses agreement for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} customers
to facilitate the transfer of personal data outside the EU
in accordance with the EU data privacy laws.
EU Model clauses are relevant to all customers
that send personal information about EU citizens to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

To request an EU Model Clauses agreement,
or for any other information or assistance around the transfer of personal data,
customers can email the dedicated EU Model Clauses team at eu-mc@ie.ibm.com.

The EU Directive 95/46/EC sets out rules about the processing of customer's personal data.
As the data controller,
customers appoint {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} as a data processor to process any personal data that might be included in the customer's content.
In turn,
customers are responsible for obtaining all necessary consents
to include the content (including any personal data) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} solutions.

A list of countries where content might be held,
or from where content might be accessed,
for delivering and supporting a Cloud Service,
is available at [www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters){: new_window}{: external}.

Cloudant will not move your data without notification. Cloudant do rely on centralised components for aspects of the service. 
Of particular interest for data residency are logs containing URLs. These will be sent out of region specific infrastructure, 
to centralised logging components. For any data where residency is a concern, avoid its inclusion within URLs such as in the 
path or querystring. Cloudant documentation describes how this can be achieved for various areas of our API.

compliance with emerging data privacy standards and legislation. 
Customers also need to be aware of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s wider ability to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions
