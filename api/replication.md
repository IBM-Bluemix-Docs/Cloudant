# Replication
{: #replication-api}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} replication is the process that synchronizes the state of two databases.
{: shortdesc}

Any change that occurred in the source database is reproduced in the target database.
You can create replications between any number of databases, either continuously or as a "one off" task.

Depending on your application requirements,
you use replication to share and aggregate state and content.

Replication takes place in one direction only.
To keep two databases synchronized with each other,
you must replicate in both directions.
Complete this process by replicating from `database1` to `database2`,
and separately from `database2` to `database1`.

First, when replication finishes, all active documents in the source database also exist in the destination or "target" database. Second, documents deleted from the source database are also removed from the destination database (if they exist there). 

## Replication operation
{: #replication-operation}

Replication has two forms: push or pull replication:

- *Push replication* is where the source is a local database,
  and the destination is a remote database.
- *Pull replication* is where the source is a remote database instance,
  and the destination is the local database.

Pull replication is helpful if your source database has a permanent IP address,
and your destination database is local and has a dynamically assigned IP address,
for example, obtained through DHCP.
Pull replication is especially appropriate if you are replicating to a mobile or other device from a central server.

In all cases,
the requested databases in the source and target specification must exist.
If they do not,
an error is returned within the JSON object.

See the following example request to replicate between a database on the source server `example.com`, and a target database on {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}:

```http
POST /_replicate
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "source" : "https://$USERNAME1:$PASSWORD1@example.com/db",
  "target" : "https://$USERNAME2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT2.cloudant.com/db",
}
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example error response if one of the requested databases for a replication does not exist:

```json
{
  "error" : "db_not_found",
  "reason" : "could not open https://example.com/db/"
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Important notes
{: #important-notes}

* A new and more powerful [replication scheduler](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#the-replication-scheduler)
  changes the previous behavior of the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} replication mechanisms.
  Ensure that your applications are updated.
* Replications can severely impact the performance of an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance.
  Performance testing helps you understand the impact on your environment
  under an increasing number of concurrent replications.
* [Continuous replication](#continuous-replication) can result in many internal calls.
  Requiring many calls might affect the costs for multi-tenant users of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} systems.
  By default,
  continuous replication is not enabled.
* The target database must exist.
  It is not automatically created if it does not exist.
  Add `"create_target":true` to the JSON document that describes the replication
  if the target database does not exist before replication.
  For more information about creating the target database, see [Creating a target database during replication](#creating-a-target-database-during-replication).
* Replicator databases must be maintained and looked after,
  just like any other valuable data store.
  For more information,
  see [replication database maintenance](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#replication-database-maintenance).
  
For security purposes, the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} team recommends that you use IAM API keys or  {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} legacy authentication [API keys](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-authorization#api-keys){: new_window} rather than account-level credentials for replication jobs. For more information, see the [IAM guide](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-identity-and-access-management-iam-#ibm-cloud-identity-and-access-management-iam-){: new_window} or the legacy [Authentication API document](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-authentication#authentication){: new_window} and the legacy [Authorization API document](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-authorization#authorization){: new_window}.
{: important}

## The `_replicator` database
{: #the-_replicator-database}

The `_replicator` database is a special database within your account,
where you can `PUT` or `POST` replication documents to specify the replications you want.

Before you start a replication, you must create the `_replicator` database. 
To create a database, send a `PUT` request to:

```http
https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_replicator
```
For more information, see [Databases](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases#databases).

To cancel a replication,
you `DELETE` the replication document.
The fields that are supplied in the replication document are
described in the [Replication document format](#replication-document-format).

All design documents and `_local` documents added to the `/_replicator` database are ignored.
{: note}

## Replication document format
{: #replication-document-format}

You must use the *full* URL when you specify the source and target databases in a replication document.
{: note}

The format of the document that is used to describe a replication is as follows:

Field Name | Required | Description
-----------|----------|-------------
`source` | yes | Identifies the database to copy revisions from. Can be a database URL, or an object whose url property contains the full URL of the database.
`target` | yes | Identifies the database to copy revisions to. Same format and interpretation as source. Does not have to be the same value as the `source` field.
`continuous` | no | Continuously synchronizes state from the `source` to the `target`, stopping only when deleted.
`create_target` | no | A value of `true` tells the replicator to create the `target` database if it does not exist.
`create_target_params` | no | Provides a way to customize the target database that is created on a new replication. You can also customize the cluster's default values for the number of shards and replicas to create. 
`doc_ids` | no | Array of document IDs; if given, only these documents are replicated.
`filter` | no | Name of a [filter function](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-design-documents#filter-functions), which is defined in a design document. The filter function determines which documents get replicated. Using the `selector` option provides performance benefits when compared with using the `filter` option. Use the `selector` option when possible.
`proxy` | no | Proxy server URL.
`query_params` | no | A field that contains key:value pairs, for use in [filter function](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-design-documents#filter-functions).
`selector` | no | Provide a simple filter to select the documents that are included in the replication. Using the `selector` option provides performance benefits when compared with using the `filter` option. For more information, see the [`selector`](#the-selector-field) documentation.
`since_seq` | no | Override the incremental nature of replication. For more information, see the [`since_seq`](#the-since_seq-field) documentation.
`use_checkpoints` | no | Indicate whether to create checkpoints. Checkpoints greatly reduce the time and resources that are needed for repeated replications. Setting this field to `false` removes the requirement for write access to the `source` database. Defaults to `true`.
`user_ctx` | no | An object that contains the user name and optionally an array of roles, for example: `"user_ctx": {"name": "jane", "roles": ["admin"]} `. This object is needed for the replication to show up in the output of `/_active_tasks`.
{: caption="Table 1. Replication document format" caption-side="top"}

Optionally, replication documents can have a user-defined `_id`.
{: note}

### The `selector` field
{: #the-selector-field}

If you do not want to replicate the entire contents of a database,
you can specify a simple filter in the `selector` field.
The filter takes the form of an [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query#query) selector object.

Using a selector object provides performance benefits when compared with using a
[filter function](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-design-documents#filter-functions).
Use the `selector` option where possible.

The selector object identifies a field (such as `_id` in the following example),The selector object identifies a field, such as `_id` in the following example, and an expression, such as `"$gte": "d2"`, that must be true for that field for the selector to allow the document to replicate. In the following example,
only documents that have a `_id` field with a value greater than or equal to `"d2"` are replicated.

See the following example `selector` object in a replication document:

```json
{
  "source": "https://$ACCOUNT1.cloudant.com/$DATABASE1",
  "target": "https://$ACCOUNT2.cloudant.com/$DATABASE2",
  "selector": {
    "_id": {
      "$gte": "d2"
    }
  },
  "continuous": true
}
```
{: codeblock}

An HTTP [`400`](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-http#http-status-codes) error is returned if a problem occurs with the replication request.
The error includes more details about the problem in the `"reason"` field of the response.
The reason might be one of:

- The {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query selector object is missing.
- The selector object is not valid JSON.
- The selector object does not describe a valid {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query.

More information about using a `selector` object is available in the
[Apache CouchDB documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/api/database/changes.html#selector){: new_window}{: external}.

See the following example error response if the selector is not valid:

```json
{
  "error": "bad request",
  "reason": "<details of the problem>"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### The `since_seq` field
{: #the-since_seq-field}

If you do not want to replicate the entire contents of a database,
you can specify a "replication sequence value" in the `since_seq` field.

The replication sequence value indicates how far to step "through" a database,
for example as part of a replication.
Setting the contents of the `since_seq` field to this value ensures that the replication starts from that point,
rather than from the very beginning.

The `since_seq` field might be used for creating incremental copies of databases. Follow these steps to set the `since_seq` field:

1.  Find the ID of the checkpoint document for the last replication.
  It is stored in the `_replication_id` field of the replication document in the [`_replicator` database](#the-_replicator-database).
2.  Open the checkpoint document at `/$DATABASE/_local/$REPLICATION_ID`,
  where `$REPLICATION_ID` is the ID you found in the previous step,
  and `$DATABASE` is the name of the source or the target database.
  The document usually exists on both databases but might exist on only one.
3.  Search for the `recorded_seq` field of the first element in the history array.
4.  Set the `since_seq` field in the replication document to the value of the `recorded_seq` field.
5.  Replicate to a new database.

By definition, using `since_seq` disables the normal replication checkpointing facility, so use `since_seq` with caution.
{: note}

## Creating a replication
{: #creating-a-replication}

Replications are created in 1 of 2 ways:

1.  A replication can be created by using a [replication document](#replication-document-format)
  in the `_replicator` database.
  Creating and modifying replications in this way enables control of a replication
  in the same way as working with other documents.
  Replication jobs created this way are resumed automatically after a node restart.
2.  A replication can be started by `POST`ing a JSON document that describes the wanted replication
  directly to the `/_replicate` endpoint.
  Replication jobs created this way are *not* resumed if the node they run on is restarted.
  The JSON document has the same format as the JSON documents you store in the
  [`/_replicator`](#the-_replicator-database) database.

The first method, where you store a replication document in the `_replicator` database, is the preferred approach.
{: note}

To start a replication,
add a [replication document](#replication-document-format) to the `_replicator` database.

See the following example instructions for using HTTP to create a replication document:

```http
PUT /_replicator/replication-doc HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example instructions for using the command line to create a replication document:

```sh
curl -X PUT "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_replicator/replication-doc" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @replication-document.json
# assuming replication-document.json is a json file with valid replication information.
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example replication document:

```json
{
  "source": "https://$ACCOUNT1:$PASSWORD1@$ACCOUNT1.cloudant.com/$DATABASE1",
  "target": "https://$ACCOUNT2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT2.cloudant.com/$DATABASE2",
  "create_target": true,
  "continuous": true
}
```
{: codeblock}

### Creating a target database during replication
{: #creating-a-target-database-during-replication}

If your user credentials allow it,
you can create the target database during replication by adding the `create_target` field to the request object.

The `create_target` field is not destructive.
If the database exists,
the replication proceeds as normal.

See the following example request to create a target database and replicate onto it:

```http
POST http://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_replicate
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "create_target" : true
  "source" : "http://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@example.com/db",
  "target" : "http://$USERNAME2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/db",
}
```
{: codeblock}

### Creating a replication within an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment
{: #creating-a-replication-within-an-ibm-cloud-environment}

You can replicate an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} database to one or more {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} environments.
When you set up the replication job for each environment,
the source database and target database names you provide must use the following format:

```http
https://$ACCOUNT:$PASSWORD@$REMOTE_USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE_NAME
```
{: codeblock}

You create the database within {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} by using the name: `$DATABASE_NAME`,
and add it to the URL format.
Do not copy the `URL` field from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

## Canceling a replication
{: #canceling-a-replication}

To cancel a replication,
[delete its replication document](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-documents#delete-a-document) from the `_replicator` database.

If you created the replication by sending a JSON document to the `/_replicate` endpoint,
you can cancel the replication by sending a revised JSON document to the `/_replicate` endpoint.
The revised document must be identical to the original replication request,
but have an additional `"cancel":true` field.
For more information,
see [The `/_replicate` endpoint](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#the-_replicate-endpoint).

If the replication is in an [`error` state](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#replication-status),
the replicator makes repeated attempts to achieve a successful replication.
A consequence is that the replication document is updated with each attempt.
This update also changes the document revision value.
Therefore,
get the revision value immediately before you delete the document,
otherwise you might get an [HTTP 409 "document update conflict"](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-http#http-status-codes) response.

See the following example instructions for using HTTP to delete a replication document:

```http
DELETE /_replicator/replication-doc?rev=1-... HTTP/1.1
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example instructions for deleting a replication document, the command line:

```sh
curl -X DELETE "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_replicator/replication-doc?rev=1-..."
```
{: codeblock}

## Monitoring a replication
{: #monitoring-a-replication}

To monitor replicators currently in process,
a simple method is to make a `GET` request to `https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_active_tasks`.
This request returns any active tasks,
including replications.
To filter for replications,
look for documents with `"type": "replication"`.

A more powerful and comprehensive approach to monitoring replication is available
by using the replication scheduler.
More details about using the scheduler are available in the [advanced replication information](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#replication-status) 

If you monitor the `_active_tasks` and find that the state of a replication is not changing,
you might have a "stalled" replication.
If you are sure that the replication stalled,
contact {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} support for assistance.

For more information,
see [Active tasks](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-active-tasks#active-tasks)
and [Replication status](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#replication-status).

See the following example instructions for using HTTP to monitor a replication:

```http
GET /_active_tasks HTTP/1.1
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example instructions for using the command line to monitor a replication:

```http
curl "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_active_tasks"
```
{: codeblock}

<!--

See the following example instructions for using Javascript to monitor a replication:

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$ACCOUNT+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$ACCOUNT+".cloudant.com");

account.request(
	{ path: '_active_tasks' },
	function (err, body, headers) {
		if (!err) {
			console.log( body.filter( function (task) {
						return (task.type === 'replication');
					} ) ); 
		}
	}
);

## Single replication
{: #single-replication}

Replication of a database means that the two databases,
the "source" and the "target",
are synchronized.
By default,
the replication process occurs one time,
and synchronizes the two databases together.

The response to a request for a single replication is a JSON structure
that contains the success or failure status of the synchronization process.
The response also contains statistics about the process.

Field             | Purpose
------------------|--------
`history`         | An array that contains the replication history.
`ok`              | Replication status.
`session_id`      | Unique session ID.
`source_last_seq` | The last sequence number read from source database.
{: caption="Table 2. Fields in a single replication response" caption-side="top"}

The `history` array contains the following information:

Field                | Purpose
---------------------|--------
`doc_write_failures` | Number of document write failures.
`docs_read`          | Number of documents read.
`docs_written`       | Number of documents written to target.
`end_last_seq`       | Last sequence number in changes stream.
`end_time`           | Date and Time replication operation completed.
`missing_checked`    | Number of missing documents checked.
`missing_found`      | Number of missing documents found.
`recorded_seq`       | Last recorded sequence number.
`session_id`         | Session ID for this replication operation.
`start_last_seq`     | First sequence number in changes stream.
`start_time`         | Date and Time replication operation started.
{: caption="Table 3. Fields in the `history` array" caption-side="top"}

{
	"source" : "http://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/recipes",
	"target" : "http://$USERNAME2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT2.cloudant.com/recipes2"
}
```

	"source_last_seq" : 1000
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Continuous replication
{: #continuous-replication}

By default,
the synchronization of a database during replication happens one time when the replicate request is made.
To ensure that replication from the source database to the target database takes place continually,
set the `continuous` field of the JSON object within the request to `true`.

With continuous replication,
changes in the source database are replicated to the target database forever 
until you specifically cancel the replication.

Changes are replicated between the two databases
while a network connection is available between the two instances.

When in operation,
the replication process does not stop when it finishes processing all current updates.
Instead,
the replication process continues to wait for further updates to the source database,
and applies them to the target.

Continuous replication forces checks to be made continuously on the source database. These checks result in an increasing number of database accesses, even if the source database content did not change. Database accesses are counted as part of the work that is done within a multi-tenant database configuration.
{: note}

See the following example instructions for using HTTP to request continuous replication:

```http
POST /_replicate HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example instructions for using the command line to request continuous replication:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_replicate HTTP/1.1" -d @replication-doc.json
# the file replication-doc.json must be supplied.
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example JSON document that describes continuous replication between the source database `recipes` and the target database `recipes2`:

```json
{
	"source" : "http://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/recipes",
	"target" : "http://$USERNAME2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT2.cloudant.com/recipes2", 
	"continuous": true
}
```
{: codeblock}

### Canceling continuous replication
{: #canceling-continuous-replication}

Cancel continuous replication by including the `cancel` field in the JSON request object,
and setting the value to `true`.

For the cancellation request to succeed, the structure of the request must be identical to the original request. In particular, if you requested continuous replication, the cancellation request must also contain the `continuous` field.
{: note}

Requesting cancellation of a replication that does not exist results in a [404 error](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-http#http-status-codes).

See the following example replication request to create the target database if it does not exist, and to replicate continuously:

```json
{
	"source" : "http://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@example.com/db",
	"target" : "http://$USERNAME2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/db",
	"create_target" : true,
	"continuous" : true
}
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example request to cancel the replication, providing matching fields to the original request:

```json
{
	"cancel" : true,
	"continuous" : true,
	"create_target" : true,
	"source" : "http://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@example.com/db",
	"target" : "http://$USERNAME2:$PASSWORD2@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/db"
}
```
{: codeblock}


## Replication errors
{: #replication-errors}

When you replicate to a target cluster with these size [limits](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public#request-and-document-size-limits), 
documents that exceed any of the limits are not replicated. For continuous replications, monitor the `_active_tasks` endpoint and check 
the replication task's `doc_write_failures` counter. If the `doc_write_failures` counter is not `0`, 
it means that some documents did 
not replicate. If replication is not continuous, and already finished, the `doc_write_failures` 
counter can be found in the replication document's `_replication_stats` object.

See the following example replication sequence:

The following examples go through all the steps of creating a replication task,
then canceling it.

See the following example of using HTTP to send a request to start a replication:

```http
POST /_replicate HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example of using the command line to send a request to start a replication:
